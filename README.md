# How to run the project

1. npm install
2. npm run start

## TODOS

1. better error handling (catch the error and do something with it)
2. i18n so we don't have static texts
3. add breakpoints
4. check performance improvements
5. contrast on leaderboard to make it more accessible
6. do more tests and have more test coverage

## Notes

Since no BE was provided, the project is running json server concurrently with the default npm run start
